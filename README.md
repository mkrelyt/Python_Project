Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company's ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers. 

The dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

While this dataset covers multiple attributes to the sale of multiple products, I will be focusing on three attributes that I believe could have the most impact on a single product.  The analysis is focused on age, education, and year of birth and how they possibly correlate with the sale of wine for a business.

The presentation and results of this analysis can be found here https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-UNXaqo8LXs-O3klD1CVp1WpJ1m1ChfULsEKI5SVtUI/edit?usp=sharing
