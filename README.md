The dataset was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis

While this dataset covers mutliple attributes to the sale of multiple products, I will be focusing on three attributes that I believe could have the most impact on a single product.  The analysis is focused on age, education, and year of birth and how they possibly correlate with the sale of wine for a business.
